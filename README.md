## Objectives

The main goals of this analysis are to:

-  Determine if users spend more time on the **new landing page** than the old one.
-  Compare **conversion rates** between the new and old landing pages.
-  Examine if **conversion rates differ by preferred language**.
-  Assess whether **time spent on the new page varies by language**.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- View data shape and structure
- Summary statistics
- Check for missing values and duplicates

### Univariate & Bivariate Analysis
- Explore individual variables
- Analyze relationships between features

### Hypothesis Testing Framework
Each business question is addressed using a structured 7-step hypothesis testing method:

1. Define the null and alternative hypotheses  
2. Choose the appropriate test  
3. Set the significance level (Î±)  
4. Prepare and transform data  
5. Compute the test statistic and p-value  
6. Compare the p-value with Î±  
7. Draw conclusions and interpret the result

#### Statistical Tests Used:
- t-tests
- Z-tests
- Chi-square tests
- ANOVA
